The United States is Tesla's largest sales market. Revenue rises on model additions More than 71 billion U.S. dollars of the company's revenue is generated from Tesla's automotive segment, which includes the design, manufacturing, and sales of vehicles. As of March 2020, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a model range that includes the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, Tesla Model 3, and the Tesla Model Y. The production of the anticipated Cybertruck, the brand's light truck model, has been delayed. Mass production for the model is estimated to happen in 2024. Model 3 legacy The Model Y has emerged as Tesla's best-selling vehicle, leading the ranking in worldwide plug-in vehicle sales in 2022. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass one million global sales. Much of Tesla's spending has specifically been on production of its Model 3 and Model Y, a strongly popular vehicles with high demand. One response to this surge in popularity for the Model 3 was Tesla's 2018 purchase of land for the construction of a Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. A factory within China will provide Tesla steady access to the Chinese electric vehicle market, a consistency welcomed in the midst of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policies.

I found 3 main ways to solve this question, the 1st approach is brute force with time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(1): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): for i in range(0, len(array)): for j in range(i+1, len(array)): if array[i] + array[j] == targetSum: return ([array[i], array[j]]) return [] The 2nd approach is using hash map with time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): matches = {} for number in array: match = targetSum - number if match in matches: return [match, number] else: matches[number] = True return [] The 3rd approach is with two pointers of left and right. This method has time complexity of O(nlogn) and space complexity of O(1): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): array.sort() left = 0 right = len(array) - 1 while left < right: if array[left] + array[right] == targetSum: return [array[left], array[right]] elif array[left] + array[right] < targetSum: left +=1 elif array[left] + array[right] > targetSum: right -=1 return [] ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications answered Apr 5, 2021 at 14:35 Niyousha MohammadshafieNiyousha Mohammadshafie 19111 silver badge66 bronze badges Add a comment | This answer is useful 2 This answer is not useful Save this answer.
