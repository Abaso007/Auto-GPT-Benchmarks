The United States is Tesla's largest sales market. Revenue rises on model additions More than 71 billion U.S. dollars of the company's revenue is generated from Tesla's automotive segment, which includes the design, manufacturing, and sales of vehicles. As of March 2020, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a model range that includes the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, Tesla Model 3, and the Tesla Model Y. The production of the anticipated Cybertruck, the brand's light truck model, has been delayed. Mass production for the model is estimated to happen in 2024. Model 3 legacy The Model Y has emerged as Tesla's best-selling vehicle, leading the ranking in worldwide plug-in vehicle sales in 2022. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass one million global sales. Much of Tesla's spending has specifically been on production of its Model 3 and Model Y, a strongly popular vehicles with high demand. One response to this surge in popularity for the Model 3 was Tesla's 2018 purchase of land for the construction of a Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. A factory within China will provide Tesla steady access to the Chinese electric vehicle market, a consistency welcomed in the midst of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policies.

So even if the number exists twice, you won't be able to use it. You should instead build a dictionary of number => indices and iterate over that. \\u2013\\u00a0fafl Jun 7, 2018 at 14:22 @mkrieger1 it supposes to return the indices of the two value in nums that will add up to the target in the form [i,j] \\u2013\\u00a0Eliza Jun 7, 2018 at 14:28 @fafl I see. So it only finds the first occurance of that value.. sad.

I found 3 main ways to solve this question, the 1st approach is brute force with time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(1): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): for i in range(0, len(array)): for j in range(i+1, len(array)): if array[i] + array[j] == targetSum: return ([array[i], array[j]]) return [] The 2nd approach is using hash map with time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): matches = {} for number in array: match = targetSum - number if match in matches: return [match, number] else: matches[number] = True return [] The 3rd approach is with two pointers of left and right. This method has time complexity of O(nlogn) and space complexity of O(1): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): array.sort() left = 0 right = len(array) - 1 while left < right: if array[left] + array[right] == targetSum: return [array[left], array[right]] elif array[left] + array[right] < targetSum: left +=1 elif array[left] + array[right] > targetSum: right -=1 return [] ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications answered Apr 5, 2021 at 14:35 Niyousha MohammadshafieNiyousha Mohammadshafie 19111 silver badge66 bronze badges Add a comment | This answer is useful 2 This answer is not useful Save this answer.

This works and can do it in a single pass: from collections import defaultdict # Returns the indices of two numbers that add up to the target def two_sums(nums, target): lookup = defaultdict(list) for i, num in enumerate(nums): needed = target - num if needed in lookup: return [lookup[needed][0], i] lookup[num].append(i) return None print(two_sums([2,7,11,15], 17)) print(two_sums([3, 3], 6)) ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications answered Jun 7, 2018 at 14:31 faflfafl 7,21233 gold badges2727 silver badges5050 bronze badges 2 1 This is a great solution using defaultdict to avoid key error.
